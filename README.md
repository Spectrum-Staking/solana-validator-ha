# solana-validator-ha

A gossip-based high availability (HA) manager for Solana validators. This tool helps automate **unexpected** failovers due to `<insert one of endless reasons>`.
To automate **planned** failovers, see [solana-validator-failover](https://github.com/SOL-Strategies/solana-validator-failover)

## Demo

`validator-1` (active) loses network connectivity. A passive peer detects the leaderless cluster and takes over automatically.

Passive node (`validator-2`) monitoring the cluster and promoting itself to active:

![passive node takeover](docs/passive-node.gif)

Active node (`validator-1`) detecting it has dropped from gossip and stepping down:

![active node handover](docs/active-node.gif)

## How it works

`solana-validator-ha` provides a simple, low-dependency HA solution for running 2 or more Solana validators together, where one is `active` (voting) and the rest are `passive` (non-voting). All peers share the same `active` keypair identity and each has its own unique `passive` keypair identity.

Each peer runs `solana-validator-ha` independently. It monitors the Solana gossip network to detect whether any peer is currently active and voting. When no active peer has been seen for a configurable number of consecutive samples (the _leaderless threshold_), a failover is triggered. Each peer makes this decision independently using the same gossip data, with a rank-based delay to prevent multiple peers from racing to become active simultaneously.

A node will only become active in a failover if:

1. It appears in gossip (the validator process is running and reachable on the network);
2. Its local RPC reports healthy;
3. It has been continuously healthy for at least `failover.self_healthy.minimum_duration` (guards against startup health flaps); and
4. Once the cluster runs Alpenglow, it reports the same Alpenglow genesis as the cluster (see [Alpenglow](#alpenglow)).

To make this work, two (‼️**VERY**‼️) important user-supplied commands are required:

### 🟢 Active command

Called when this node should assume the `active` role. See [example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh](example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh) for inspiration.

```yaml
failover:
  active:
    command: "set-identity-with-rollback.sh"
    args: [
      "--active-identity-file", "{{ .ActiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
      "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
    ]
```

### 🔴 Passive command

Called when this node should assume a `passive` (non-voting) role — a.k.a _Seppuku_. This command **must be idempotent**: it may be called any time the node detects it should not be active (e.g. when it drops out of gossip). The safest pattern is to configure validators to **always** start with a `passive` identity, so this command can simply restart the validator service and wait for it to come back passive. See [example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh](example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh) for inspiration.

```yaml
failover:
  passive:
    # ⚠️ This must make absolutely sure the validator goes passive.
    # ⚠️ If set-identity fails, restart/stop the service, pull the plug,
    # ⚠️ or call your mum crying for help. Do WHATEVER is necessary.
    command: "seppuku.sh"
    args: [
      "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
    ]
```

> **Note:** `post-passive` hooks only run if the passive command succeeds, as a safeguard against false positives.

## Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Peer Detection**: Automatically detects validator roles based on network gossip and RPC identity
- **🛡️ Startup Health Protection**: Requires a configurable minimum continuous healthy streak before a node can become a failover candidate
- **🪝 Hooks**: Pre/Post failover hook support for role transitions
- **📊 Prometheus Metrics**: Rich metrics collection for monitoring and alerting
- **🏁 First-Responder Failover**: Race-based failover with deterministic rank-based delay so the highest-priority eligible passive validator assumes the active role. Default ordering is ascending IP sort; operators can override with explicit `failover.priority` per node
- **📼 Incident Recording**: Optionally checkpoints timestamped JSON from the first anomalous network observation through recovery, demotion, or takeover — for multi-node diagnosis and replay

### Using Local RPC as a Failsafe Fallback

Public RPC endpoints can rate-limit or block requests (`403 Forbidden`, `429 Too Many Requests`), which prevents `getClusterNodes` from returning gossip data and causes log noise like:

```
ERRO [gossip_state]: failed to get cluster nodes
  error= method call failed on all RPC endpoints method: GetClusterNodes,
         attempted_urls: [https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com],
         errors: [403 "Access forbidden"]
```

Adding the local validator RPC alongside your remote URLs provides a fallback that is always available and never rate-limited:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: "mainnet-beta"
  rpc_urls:
    - "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"  # remote — may rate-limit
    - "http://localhost:8899"                # local — immune to rate limits
```

A warning is logged at startup to remind you of the trade-off:

```
WARN config: cluster.rpc_urls contains the local validator RPC URL (http://localhost:8899)
     — ensure HA peers are configured as mutual --entrypoint flags for direct gossip,
       otherwise peer state may be stale
```

#### When the local RPC is ideal: mutual `--entrypoint` flags

When each HA peer is listed as an `--entrypoint` in the other peers' agave config, they exchange gossip directly over UDP (CRDS). The local RPC then has sub-second fresh data for every peer — better than remote RPCs that see gossip after network propagation.

```
# On validator-1 (185.26.11.91)
--entrypoint validator-2.example.com:8001

# On validator-2
--entrypoint validator-1.example.com:8001
```

#### When the local RPC is a last-resort fallback

Without mutual `--entrypoint` flags, the local validator learns about peers through the wider gossip network. Peer data may be 30–60 s stale. This is still better than a complete `getClusterNodes` failure: the system keeps working with slightly older data rather than losing all visibility. The multi-URL retry logic means the remote URLs are always tried first; the local RPC is only reached if all remote calls fail.

#### Automatic URL cooldown

When any URL (local or remote) returns a `403`, `429`, or `503` response, `solana-validator-ha` automatically deprioritises that URL for 60 s and logs a warning:

```
WARN [rpc_client]: RPC endpoint rate-limited or access forbidden, cooling down
     method=GetClusterNodes url=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com cooldown=1m0s
```

During the cooldown the URL is still retried as a last resort, but healthy URLs are always attempted first.

## Delinquency Fast-Path

`solana-validator-ha` can optionally bypass the leaderless sample threshold when the Solana network itself declares the active peer delinquent via `getVoteAccounts`. Enable it with:

```yaml
failover:
  delinquency_bypass: true  # default: false
```

**What it does**: when the active peer is visible in gossip but declared delinquent (not due to a low vote account balance), failover is triggered immediately on the current gossip refresh — no further confirmation samples are needed.

**Why it can help — the "ghost validator" scenario**: the active validator is running and reachable in gossip but has stopped voting. Without the bypass, detection requires the full `leaderless_samples_threshold × poll_interval_duration` (~15 s at defaults) _on top of_ the delinquency detection time (~30–51 s). With the bypass, failover triggers as soon as delinquency is declared by the cluster.

**Why it is disabled by default — fork recovery risk**: a validator that lands on a minority fork will appear delinquent from the canonical chain's perspective, but may recover on its own once the fork dies. If the bypass fires during that window and the validator subsequently recovers, you risk two nodes briefly holding the active identity simultaneously — a double-signing scenario. The leaderless sample threshold provides a natural recovery window: if the validator comes back and votes again, the next gossip refresh clears the delinquency flag and the failover is aborted.

**When it is safe to enable**: if your validator can enter a "ghost" state — running, in gossip, but permanently stopped voting — that it cannot self-recover from, and your network conditions make prolonged minority forks very unlikely. Most operators running on well-connected infrastructure with stable peers do not need this.

**Low-balance exemption**: validators delinquent due to a sub-rent-exempt vote account balance (~0.00089 SOL) are explicitly excluded from the bypass. This is a funding issue, not a validator failure, and should not trigger a failover.

The delinquency threshold used for detection is `failover.delinquent_slot_distance_override` (if configured) or the Agave default of 128 slots (~51 s).

The fast-path only applies while the cluster runs TowerBFT. Under Alpenglow it is ignored (with a warning), because vote-lag evidence replaces delinquency; see [Alpenglow](#alpenglow).

## Alpenglow

Alpenglow replaces TowerBFT votes with BLS votes that are aggregated into certificates. Gossip presence still means the same thing, but the voting signals change meaning:

- **`lastVote`** in `getVoteAccounts` is only updated when a certificate that includes the validator lands in a block, so a healthy validator trails the tip by up to ~9 slots instead of ~1–3.
- **`getHealth`** compares the local node against the highest *finalized* slot, and reports unknown until the node has seen a finalization. It no longer agrees with the 128-slot delinquency threshold.
- **A cluster-wide stall** (no finalization) freezes every validator's `lastVote` at once. Failing over cannot help and adds equivocation risk.
- **A vote account left out of the voter set** (for example unstaked, or missing its BLS key) cannot vote from any node.

`solana-validator-ha` therefore tracks the cluster's consensus phase and judges the active peer by the rules of that phase:

| Phase | How it is detected | Active counts as down when | Vetoes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tower` | Alpenglow feature gate not active | missing from gossip, or delinquent / no vote account (unchanged) | none |
| `migrating` / `unknown` | feature gate active but no Alpenglow genesis certificate yet / nothing answered | missing from gossip only; vote evidence is ignored | none |
| `alpenglow` (warm-up) | `getAgGenesisCert` returned a certificate; finalized slot ≤ genesis + `warmup_slots` | missing from gossip only | none |
| `alpenglow` | as above, after the warm-up | missing from gossip, or vote lag > `vote_lag_slots_threshold` while the cluster finalizes | stall, excluded vote account, local genesis |

- **Detection.** With `cluster.consensus.mode: auto`, the phase is read from the Alpenglow feature gate account (`A1pengvuM6JEcyNuTnMqepBKhwHE3N6PmUrdATGawhJS`) and `getAgGenesisCert`. RPCs that do not implement `getAgGenesisCert` are skipped, and the local validator is asked instead. Once a genesis certificate is seen, the phase stays `alpenglow` for the life of the process.
- **Vote lag.** `lastVote` and the processed slot are read from the same RPC node, so the lag is not skewed by nodes at different heights. The active counts as not voting only while the cluster keeps finalizing (the finalized slot advanced within `finalization_stall_duration`) and at least `network_current_stake_ratio_min` of stake is current. A finalization certificate needs 60% of stake, so if the cluster finalizes and the active's votes still do not land, the fault is local to the active. At the defaults a zombie active is replaced in ~25–30 s, instead of ~66 s through delinquency.
- **Vetoes.** A stalled cluster or an excluded vote account is logged, counted in `solana_validator_ha_failover_vetoes_total`, and does not count against the active. A leaderless streak in which the active was ever missing from gossip is never vetoed: a dead host is dead during a stall too.
- **Local genesis.** Under Alpenglow a passive node is only promoted if its local validator reports the cluster's Alpenglow genesis slot, on top of the usual health checks. Otherwise the takeover is aborted (`aborted_local_not_migrated`) and the next-ranked peer takes over.

### Vote history on failover

Under Alpenglow, a validator restores its vote history for the new identity on `set-identity`, and starts a fresh one when there is none. The vote history file plays the role the tower file used to. If your active command copies the tower file to the new active before switching identity, copy the vote history file as well. `solana-validator-ha` does not move files itself.

### Before the migration

Keep `cluster.consensus.mode: auto`. Check that your `cluster.rpc_urls` answer `getAgGenesisCert`; the local validator is used when they do not. To try the new behaviour without acting on it, run a second instance with `failover.dry_run: true` and a separate metrics port, and compare `solana_validator_ha_active_vote_lag_slots` against `vote_lag_slots_threshold`.

## Failover Priority

By default, when multiple passive nodes are all eligible to take over, they use their public IP addresses (ascending sort) to break the tie. The node with the lowest IP gets rank 0 and takes over immediately; higher-ranked nodes wait `rank × poll_interval_duration` before attempting takeover.

Operators can override this ordering with explicit priorities:

```yaml
# On the node that should take over first (highest priority):
failover:
  priority: 0
  peers:
    backup-validator-1:
      ip: 192.168.1.11
      priority: 1
    backup-validator-2:
      ip: 192.168.1.12
      priority: 2

# On backup-validator-1:
failover:
  priority: 1
  peers:
    primary-validator:
      ip: 192.168.1.10
      priority: 0
    backup-validator-2:
      ip: 192.168.1.12
      priority: 2
```

**Rules:**

- Lower `priority` value = higher priority (rank 0 = takes over immediately).
- If any node declares a `priority`, **all** nodes (self + every entry in `failover.peers`) must declare one. A partially-configured cluster is rejected at startup.
- Priority values must be unique across self and all peers. Duplicates are rejected at startup.
- All nodes in the cluster should agree on the same priority ordering to avoid races. `solana-validator-ha` cannot enforce cross-node consistency, but logs the effective rank and ranking source (`config priority` vs `IP address`) at takeover time so mismatches are easy to spot.

## Incident Recording

When `failover.recording.enabled: true`, `solana-validator-ha` starts a recording on the first leaderless sample, gossip RPC error, self-gossip absence, or delinquency signal. It checkpoints the incident until the network recovers or the node reaches a terminal failover decision. This records the former active node's view as well as the takeover candidates' views without requiring shared infrastructure.

While an incident is open, the latest state is stored atomically as `*.json.partial`. On the next start, a valid partial is finalized with the `interrupted` outcome so a process crash does not erase the available timeline. Recording failures are logged but never block an HA decision.

### File naming

```
svha-<pubkey>-<timestamp-with-milliseconds>-<producer-ip>-<incident-id>-recording.json
```

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `<pubkey>` | Active identity pubkey — shared across all HA peers, so files from different nodes for the same failover event share this prefix |
| `<timestamp>` | UTC time the incident was detected, formatted as `20060102T150405.000Z` |
| `<producer-ip>` | Public IP of the node that wrote the file, with dots replaced by underscores (e.g. `185_26_11_91`) |
| `<incident-id>` | Process-local unique identifier that prevents collisions between recordings beginning in the same millisecond |

Example: `svha-VotePubkey1111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143022.127Z-185_26_11_91-18e...-1-recording.json`

Because the timestamp is derived from each node's independent poll cycle, files from two nodes for the same failover event will have slightly different timestamps (up to one poll interval apart). Sort by `<pubkey>` first, then `<timestamp>` to find the matching pair.

### What is captured

Each recording file contains a single JSON object with:

- **`schema_version`** — format version for forward-compatible parsing
- **`node`** — identity of the node that wrote the file (name, public IP, passive pubkey)
- **`config`** — relevant configuration snapshot (poll interval, leaderless threshold, delinquency bypass, consensus mode and Alpenglow thresholds, etc.)
- **`detected_at`** — UTC timestamp when the leaderless condition was first detected
- **`gossip_samples`** — pre-incident and live samples with peer state, RPC status, local role/health, self-gossip presence, elapsed incident time, and (schema v3) the consensus phase, why the sample was leaderless, and any Alpenglow veto
- **`timeline`** — ordered decisions and actions, including ranking, guardrails, hooks, commands, durations, and identity confirmation
- **`outcome`** — recovery, demotion, promotion, guardrail, abort, failure, or interruption result for this node

### Configuration

```yaml
failover:
  recording:
    enabled: true
    output_dir: "/var/log/solana-validator-ha/recordings"  # default: config file directory
```

The output directory is validated at startup — `solana-validator-ha` will refuse to start if it does not exist or is not writable.

### Replay

The `solana-validator-ha replay` command accepts one or more recording files and prints a merged, chronological timeline across all nodes — useful for correlating what each node observed during the same failover event.

```bash
solana-validator-ha replay \
  svha-VotePubkey111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143022.127Z-185_26_11_91-<incident-id>-recording.json \
  svha-VotePubkey111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143025.402Z-186_233_187_141-<incident-id>-recording.json
```

To find the matching file from the other node, filter by the shared `<pubkey>` prefix — all recordings for the same HA cluster carry the same pubkey. The timestamps will differ by a few seconds (each node detects the failover at a different point in its own poll cycle), so sort chronologically within that prefix to find the pair.

Replay accepts schema v1, v2 and v3 recordings. It prints each producer's schema, binary version, local observations, time to first leaderless, action results, and terminal outcome. A warning is emitted when files appear to come from different clusters or their incident start times suggest clock skew.

The replay timeline is rendered as `timestamp / TTFL / peer / role / log`. Timestamps are UTC with millisecond precision. TTFL means "time to first leaderless": negative values are pre-incident context, zero is the peer's first leaderless or otherwise anomalous observation, and positive values are time since that observation. Because each peer detects and records an incident independently, TTFL is relative to that peer's own `detected_at`. Schema v1 recordings do not contain local-role observations, so their role is shown as `unknown`.

### Previewing replay output

The repository includes deterministic recording files that pass through the same JSON loader and renderer as production recordings. Review the two-node display before changing its format:

```bash
make replay-preview
```

Review winner/loser correlation with three inputs:

```bash
make replay-preview REPLAY_SCENARIO=three-node
```

Additional two-input review scenarios are `partition-recovery`, `last-node-standing`, `delinquency-bypass`, and `command-failure`, selected with the same `REPLAY_SCENARIO` variable.

The golden-output test intentionally fails when the two-node layout changes, requiring the new display to be reviewed before its snapshot is updated.

### Binary provenance

```bash
solana-validator-ha --version  # concise version
solana-validator-ha version    # version, commit, build time, Go version, OS/architecture
```

Root help also includes the binary version and lists the `run`, `replay`, and `version` commands. These commands do not load HA configuration or access the network.

## Development and testing

```bash
make dev
make test
```
